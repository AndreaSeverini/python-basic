This section also introduces the `in` operator and demonstrates its use in conjunction with loops. Additionally, it covers the break and continue statements to control the flow of the loop.

---

## 06. Strings and Characters
The Strings and Characters section delves into working with strings in Python. It covers string manipulation, including concatenation, formatting, and common string methods such as `split()`, `join()`, `lower()`, `upper()`, and more. This section also explains string indexing and slicing to extract specific characters or substrings from strings. It covers string formatting techniques using placeholders or f-strings and introduces regular expressions for advanced string manipulation.

---

## 07. Lists
The Lists section focuses on lists in Python, which are versatile and commonly used data structures. It covers list creation, accessing elements, modifying lists, and using built-in list methods. This section explains the syntax for creating lists, accessing individual elements or sublists using indexing and slicing, and modifying lists using methods such as `append()`, `insert()`, `remove()`, and more. It also covers list comprehensions and techniques for working with nested lists.

---

## 08. Tuples
The Tuples section explores tuples in Python, which are immutable sequences. It covers tuple creation, accessing elements, modifying tuples, and using built-in tuple methods. This section explains the syntax for creating tuples, accessing elements using indexing, and the immutability of tuples. It covers tuple packing and unpacking, tuple assignment, and methods such as `count()` and `index()` for tuple manipulation. Additionally, it discusses the advantages of using tuples compared to other data structures.

---

## 09. Dictionaries
The Dictionaries section explains dictionaries in Python, which are key-value pairs and provide efficient data retrieval. It covers dictionary creation, accessing elements, modifying dictionaries, and using dictionary methods. This section explains the syntax for creating dictionaries, accessing elements using keys, adding, updating, or removing key-value pairs, and utilizing dictionary methods such as `keys()`, `values()`, `items()`, and more. It also discusses dictionary comprehension and techniques for working with nested dictionaries.

---

## 10. Slicing and Indexing
The Slicing and Indexing section demonstrates how to index and slice sequences like strings, lists, and tuples in Python. It covers the concept of indexing and slicing, explaining the syntax and providing examples of extracting specific elements or substructures from sequences. This section also introduces negative indexing to access elements from the end of a sequence. Additionally, it explores advanced slicing techniques like specifying step size and using slicing to create new sequences.

---

## 11. Functions
The Functions section covers the concept of functions in Python, which allow you to encapsulate reusable blocks of code. It explains how to define and use functions, including parameters, arguments, and return values. This section covers different types of arguments, such as positional arguments, keyword arguments, variable-length arguments, and keyword variable-length arguments. It also discusses local and global variables, explaining their scope and how to modify global variables within functions.

---

## 12. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
The Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) section covers the fundamental principles of OOP in Python. It explores topics such as classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. This section provides a deeper understanding of OOP concepts and demonstrates how to design and implement object-oriented solutions in Python.

- ### 12.A OOP intro
   This file provides an introduction to OOP in Python. It explains the core concepts of OOP, including classes, objects, attributes, and methods. It demonstrates how to define classes and create objects from them. It also discusses the concepts of inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, providing practical examples to illustrate their usage.

- ### 12.B Diving Deep into Classes and Objects
   This file delves deeper into the concepts of classes and objects in Python. It explores topics such as class constructors, instance variables, class variables, instance methods, class methods, and static methods. It provides examples and explanations to help readers understand how to work with these different aspects of classes and objects.

- ### 12.C Diving Deep into Encapsulation
   This file explores the concept of encapsulation in Python. It explains the importance of encapsulation for data hiding and abstraction. It discusses access modifiers such as public, protected, and private and demonstrates how to use them to control access to class members. It also provides examples to showcase the benefits of encapsulation in maintaining code integrity and enhancing code maintainability.

- ### 12.D Diving Deep into Public And Private Method
   This file delves deeper into the concept of public and private methods in Python classes. It explains the difference between public and private methods and their significance in encapsulation. It demonstrates how to define private methods using naming conventions and showcases the advantages of using private methods in terms of code organization and readability.

- ### 12.E Diving Deep into Inheritance
   This file explores the concept of inheritance in Python. It explains how to create subclasses by inheriting properties and methods from parent classes. It covers topics such as single inheritance, multiple inheritance, method overriding, and method resolution order. It provides examples to demonstrate how inheritance can be used to create hierarchical relationships between classes and promote code reuse.

- ### 12.F Using Super()
   This topic covers how to use the `super()` function in Python to invoke methods from parent classes. It explains the concept of method resolution order (MRO) and demonstrates how to use `super()` to call the `__init__` method of parent classes. It provides an example that showcases the usage of `super()` to achieve method overriding and maintain the correct order of method execution in a class hierarchy.

## 13. Create and Import Modules
This topic covers how to create and import modules in Python. Modules allow you to organize your code into separate files, making it easier to manage and reuse. It explains the process of importing modules using the `import` statement and demonstrates how to use functions and classes from imported modules. It also covers refactoring code with modules to improve code organization and reusability.
